# Introduction
So many datasets are available, but I needed a simple and felxible-modifiable dataset for my image classification and object detection experiments. 

The dataset provides images, each consists of a randomly selected set of geometric shapes. Each shape is defined by a json document as detailed next.

, each in a randomly selected size.

So here is the shapes dataset



A lot of wonderful datasets are now available online, such as COCO or Imagenet. which is challenging the limits of computer vision. But it's not easy for us to do some small experiments with such a large number of images to quickly test the validity of algorithmn. For this reason, I created a small dataset named "yymnist" to do both classification and object detection.
