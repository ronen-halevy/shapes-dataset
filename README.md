# Introduction
There are many datasets available arround, but I needed a simple and felxible-modifiable dataset for my image classification and object detection experiments.
This is not just a dataset of randomly selected shape images, but a flexible tool which permit an easy modification of the produced images,  done by editing two json files, as detailed here below.

Meanwhile, heres an example image:

, each in a randomly selected size.

So here is the shapes dataset



A lot of wonderful datasets are now available online, such as COCO or Imagenet. which is challenging the limits of computer vision. But it's not easy for us to do some small experiments with such a large number of images to quickly test the validity of algorithmn. For this reason, I created a small dataset named "yymnist" to do both classification and object detection.
