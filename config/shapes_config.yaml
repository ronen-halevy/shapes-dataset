# Notes:
# supported shapes: circle, triangle, ellipse, square, trapezoid, rectangle, hexagon rhombus
# color field is used for class labeling in 'color' or 'color' and 'shape' mode.


# randomly rotate shapes by n*pi/4:
rotate_shapes: true # boolean
# image_size random selection:
#image_size: [[640, 640], [960, 800], [600, 800], [1000, 800]]
image_size: [[640, 640]]

# note: cnam eorder determines category id assignemt. In case of cname dups, first cname row is taken:
shapes_categories:
  # nvertices: nvertices of polygon. determines the actual shape
  # aspect_ratio: w/h. random selection from list. set 1 one for square &circle, otherwise-rectangle and ellipse
  # theta0: angle of first vertice wrt shape center. e.g for rectangular theta0 must be 45, otherwise rhombus results
  # cname: name label, but actual shape determined by nvertices
  # color: str. random selection from list.
  # height: shape height in pixels. random selection from list. shape width = height / aspect_ratio
  # active: bool. determines row inclusion in dataset generation. Related cname is included class.names and id is assigned anyway.
